## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added "Value" fields to all functions

* I added a reference to the Wikipedia "Alpha Compositing" page in the "blend_colors" function under "References". I thought this was a more appropriate place for the reference that in the Description. The contribution of this package is mainly in the data structures. There are no real algorithms or formal methods requiring citation in this package, with the exception of the alpha blending functionality ("over" rule), which is at this point standard computer graphics.
