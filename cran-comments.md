## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added "Value" fields to all functions

* I added a reference to the Wikipedia "Alpha Compositing" page in the "blend_colors" function under "References". I thought this was a more appropriate place for the reference that in the Description. There are no real algorithms or formal methods requiring citation in this package.

## R CMD check results

0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 0 notes ✔

R CMD check succeeded

* This is a new release.

## Downstream dependencies
